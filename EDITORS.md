# Editors

This file contains community driven instructions on how to set up the Ruby LSP in editors other than VS Code. For VS
Code, use the official [Ruby LSP extension](https://github.com/Shopify/vscode-ruby-lsp).

<!-- When adding a new editor to the list, either link directly to a website containing the instructions or link to a
new H2 header in this file containing the instructions. -->
